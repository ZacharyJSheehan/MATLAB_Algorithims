# Linear Regression
the algorithim begins when a user enters two, one dimensional arrays, (x and y).
if the arrays are of different lengths, then an error is displayed.
the algorithim proceeds to determine the first and third quadrants of the arrays, and uses them to determine the IQR
with the IQR, the algorithim can determine what qualifies for outliers in the given equation.
the algorithim then sorts the data points by value, and determines which, if any, are outliers.
after, the slope of the best fit line is determined, and then the intercept.
the SR and ST values are calculated, as well as the R squared values
the algorithim then returns the values of the x function, the y function, the slope, intercept, and R squared value.
