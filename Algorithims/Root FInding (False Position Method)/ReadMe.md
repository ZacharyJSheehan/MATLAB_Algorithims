# Root Finding
the algorithim requires the user to input an initial function, an upper bound, a lower bound, a stopping criterion for the estimated error, a max iteration, and a varargin value
if there is only 3 arguments entered, then 0.0001 is the assigned estimated error, and 200 is the maximum amount of iterations.
the program then determines if any of the assigned values are the root.
Then, the which bound is the positive value is determined. Then, the algorithim runs on a while loop until the estimated error or max iterations is reached.
the algorithim is able to determine which value of x is to be replaced with the new bound
then, the algorithim returns the value of the root, the Fx value, the approximate error, and the number of iterations.
