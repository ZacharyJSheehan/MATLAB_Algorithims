# Simpson's 1/3
the algorithim requires an x and y table to be entered
if the lengths of the tables are not identical, then an error is displayed
the size of the algorithim is checked to see whether or not the trapezoidal rule needs to be applied for the last segment of the approximation.
if the algorithim is not evenly spaced, then an error is displayed.
Once the algorthim has determined how many values will be used for simpson's 1/3 method, the algorithim proceeds to create it.
if the trapezoid rule is used, its value is added to the sum of simpson's 1/3 as well. 
the algorithim then returns the value I
