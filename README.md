# MATLAB_Algorithims
A directory of programs created in MATLAB that can solve a variety of algorithms
within this directory I have included 5 algorithims I developed as a second semester freshman, studying mechanical engineering at Colorado State University
The algorithims are as follows:
## Simpson's 1/3 method
## LU Factorization
## Root Finding, utilizing the False Position Method
## Linear Regression
## creating a matrix based off of two vectors
